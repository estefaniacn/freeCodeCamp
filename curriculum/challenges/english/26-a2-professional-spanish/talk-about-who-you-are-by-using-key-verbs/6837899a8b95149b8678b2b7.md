# --explanation--

The verb `terminar` means "to finish" or "to complete." 

In a work context, `terminar un informe` ("finish a report") or `terminar un proyecto` ("finish a project"), means that the report or project is completed.

Camila is `contenta` ("happy") because she completed this important task.
