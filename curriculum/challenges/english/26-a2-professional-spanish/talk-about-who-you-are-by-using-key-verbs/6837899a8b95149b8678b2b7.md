# --explanation--

`Terminar` means "to finish" or "to complete". Camila uses it in the past tense: `terminé` which means "I finished".

In a work setting, `terminar un informe` means to finish a report. For example:

`Terminé un inform.` – I finished a report.

`Importante` means something is important.

So, `terminé un informe importante` means "I finished an important report".
